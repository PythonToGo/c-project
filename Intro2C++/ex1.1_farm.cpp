// Dear course participants, 

// along with the course, I would like to work with you on 
// a small program every week. 
// In this way, you can practice the content you have learned right away. 
// At the end of the week I will submit my solution to the exercise online. 

// Here is the first exercise:

// Farmer Max has a farm with ducks and pigs. He wants to sell them. 

// Write a C++ program that welcomes the user to the farm.

// Regards,
// Rudi Buss

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Welcome to Max's Farm!" << endl;
    return 0;

}
